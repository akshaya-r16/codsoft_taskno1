Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. It uses historical passenger data and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a classification model to make predictions.

🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts passenger survival based on features such as age, gender, class, fare, and family size.
